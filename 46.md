# NIP-46

## Basic protocol flow description

`draft` `author:moustikitos`

This NIP describe the basic protocol to allow encrypted chat between multiple users.

## Definition of a common secret

NIP-04 defines a way to encrypt messages between two users.
This is possible with a common secret defined by the way a public key is built: `P = s x G`.

- P is the pubkic key (a point on `secp256k1` curve)
- s is the secret (a big integer)
- G is the generator point of `secp256k1` curve

Given two secrets `s1` and `s2` we can define the public keys `P1 = s1 x G` and `P2 = s2 x G` giving `P1 x (1/s1) = P2 x (1/s2) = G` and finally **`P1 x s2 = P2 x s1 = C`**.

- C is a point on `secp256k1` curve

`x` absissa of the point `C` (called `C.x` in this NIP from there) is used as the 256-bit key for `AES-256-CBC` encryption protocol.

## Application to more than 2 users

Idea is to encrypt the key (called `global key` in this NIP from there) used to cipherize event content for each user public key and store it in the according `p` tag.

## Encryption

- Create a random `global key`
- For each public key `Pi`:
  - Encrypt the `global key` using common secret `Ci.x = (s x Pi).x`
  - store encrypted `global key` and `Pi.x` (schnorr normalized public key) in `p` tag
- encrypt the event content according to NIP-04 using `global key` and a random `initialization vector`

## Decryption

- Get event pubkey `P`
- Compute common secret `Ci.x = (si x P).x`
- Use `Ci.x` to decrypt `<encrypted global key>` extracted from the p tag containing public key `Pi.x`
- Decrypt content with `global key` according top NIP-04

## `global key` encryption details

- `global key` size must be 256 bits (32 bytes)
- Encryption method used MUST be the `AES-256-CTR` (no initialization vector needed)

`tags` structure MUST be `["p", <ith-user public key Pi>, "", <base 64 encoded encrypted global key>]`
